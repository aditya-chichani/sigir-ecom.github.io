  <p>The eBay SIGIR 2019 eCommerce Search Challenge: High Accuracy Recall Task is organized by eBay Search group. The
    challenge targets a common problem in eCommerce search: Identifying the items to show when using non-relevance
    sorts. Users of eCommerce search applications often sort by dimensions other than relevance. Popularity, review
    score, price, distance, recency, etc. This is a notable difference from traditional information oriented search,
    including web search, where documents are surfaced in relevance order.</p>

  <p>Relevance ordering obviates the need for explicit relevant-or-not decisions on individual documents. Many well
    studied search methodologies take advantage of this. Non-relevance sorts orders are less well studied, but raise a
    number of interesting research topics. Evaluation metrics, ranking formulas, performance optimization, user
    experience, and more. These topics are discussed in the <cite><a class="blue-text" target="_blank"
        href="https://sigir-ecom.github.io/ecom18Papers/paper21.pdf"><i>High Accuracy Recall Task</i></a></cite> paper,
    published at the SIGIR 2018 Workshop on eCommerce.</p>

  <p>This search challenge focuses on the most basic aspect of this problem: identifying the items to include in the
    recall set when using non-relevance sorts. This is already a difficult problem, and includes typical search
    challenges like ambiguity, multiple query intents, etc.</p>

  <p>The challenge data consists of a set of popular search queries and a fair size set of candidate documents.
    Challenge participants make a boolean relevant-or-not decision for each query-document pair. Human judgments are
    used to create labeled training and evaluation data for a subset of the query-document pairs. Evaluation of
    submissions will be based on the traditional F1 metric, incorporating components of both recall and precision.</p>

  <p>The challenge task and the evaluation basis are only a first step. The hope is to have a challenge interesting and
    useful by itself, while at the same time fostering additional insight into the problem space. Participants are
    encouraged to provide their learning's in the form of system description papers submitted to the 2019 SIGIR Workshop
    on eCommerce. Alternative evaluation metrics (other than F1) are an obvious area to pursue, one the challenge
    organizers hope to examine during the challenge. Item price is included in dataset enabling exploration of sort-type
    specific evaluation metrics.</p>
  The challenge dataset consists of selected fields from approximately 900K listings from eBay's Collectibles
  categories, plus 150 popular search queries relevant to collectibles listings. Information provided for each listing
  includes the Title, Price, Category Breadcrumb, and an image URL. For example, a listing for a pinball machine would
  have fields like
  <ol>
    <li>Title: Bally Twilight Zone Pinball Machine</li>
    <li>Price: 3995.00</li>
    <li>Category: Collectibles > Arcade, Jukeboxes & Pinball > Pinball > Machines
    </li>
  </ol>
  plus an image URL. Queries are simply the text of the query, for example, "bally pinball machine". Query-document
  pairs selected for human judgment include a wide mix of both relevant and non-relevant pairs.

  <span class="fs-16"><strong>Phases</strong></span>
  <p>First phase of the challenge (Unsupervised phase) will start on May 17, 2019. Participants will be able to access
    the data and can start working on the given task. However, submissions will open on May 27, 2019. Starting May 27,
    2019, participants will be able to submit their predictions and a leaderboard will be generated. More details about
    the phases of the challenge is given below:</p>
  <span class="fs-16"><strong>Unsupervised Phase</strong></span>
  <p>This is the first phase of the challenge and it will be fully unsupervised. No training data will be released and
    participants are expected to predict relevance of all query-item pairs. Each submission will be judged using a held
    out evaluation set and a leaderboard will be generated.</p>
  <span class="fs-16"><strong>Supervised Phase</strong></span>
  <p>In the second phase of the challenge, we will release some training data that can be used to train a model to
    predict relevance or lack thereof. Similar to the first phase we will judge the submissions using a held out
    evaluation set and the leaderboard will be updated.</p>
  <span class="fs-16"><strong>Final Phase</strong></span>
  <p>This phase will start in the final week of the challenge and a separate evaluation set will be used to generate a
    second and the final leaderboard. No additional training data will be released. Only different held out set will be
    used to generate the final and separate leaderboard.</p>
  <span class="fs-16"><strong>Important Dates</strong></span>
  <ol>
    <li>Challenge Starts (Unsupervised Phase): May 17, 2019</li>
    <li>Submissions Open on EvalAI: May 27, 2019</li>
